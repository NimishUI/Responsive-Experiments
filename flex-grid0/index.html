                <p>I was born and raised in NYC, but <span>my real roots</span> reach to South America. I owe my travel bug to being a first generation American with family all over the world - we were always on the go!</p>

                <p><span>My passion:</span> I LOVE music - it's one of the most powerful and diverse methods for expression & communication. In the meantime, I get my fix by going to lots & lots of concerts. I'm at 160 and counting!</p>

                <p><span>A fun fact:</span> As a true New Yorker, I'm slightly embarrased to say that I only learned how to ride a plain ol' stationary bike 1 year ago, and have yet to learn to drive. But, the real takeaway is that I'm learning!</p>
